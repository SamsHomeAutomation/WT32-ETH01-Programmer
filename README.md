# WT32-ETH01-Programmer
This is a PCB designed to connect a cheap USB TTL cable, commonly available on internet auction sites, to the WT32-ETH01 development board for programming. The PCB uses FlexyPin to create a temporary connection between the programmer and the development board. You can find more information on FlexyPin at the project's GitHub page, located at https://github.com/solderparty/flexypin.

The circuit board includes a tactile switch that connects to gpio0, which can be used to put the development board into boot mode. The programmer is equipped with mounting holes that can accommodate a din rail or spacers to keep the board off surfaces.

To see 3D renders of the PCB, please refer to our documentation. Additionally, the Gerber files are compatible with PCBWay.
